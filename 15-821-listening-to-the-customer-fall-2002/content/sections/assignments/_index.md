| 3 |  {{< br >}}{{< br >}} Guest Lecture: Robert Klein, President, Applied Marketing Science, Inc. {{< br >}}{{< br >}} Mr. Klein heads a leading market research company, which has developed a very successful proprietary Voice of the Customer methodology (Vocalyst™). He will discuss this in class. As preparation, read the HBS reprint "Understanding User Needs," and the article "Puritan - Bennett - The Renaissance Spirometry System," which uses Vocalyst™. {{< br >}}{{< br >}} Check out their site: [http://www.ams-inc.com/](http://www.ams-inc.com/) {{< br >}}{{< br >}} Vocalyst is described at: [http://www.ams-inc.com/npd/vocalyst.asp](http://www.ams-inc.com/npd/vocalyst.asp) {{< br >}}{{< br >}} Note - the interview guide for the VOC exercise is due in class (1 per team). In preparing your guide, you can take a look at a 'professional quality' interview guide in the course packet (submitted by three former students). Your guide doesn't need to be as elaborate. {{< br >}}{{< br >}}  |
| 4 |  {{< br >}}{{< br >}} **Individual Assignement:** Conduct and write-up a one-on-one customer interview, as described in Consumer Behavior Exercise (A-F). There are six different version of this exercise (A,B,C,D,E,F), and everyone should have received one particular version in September. The exercise will (a) give you a chance to practice interviewing before you do it for the project; (b) give examples of good discussion guides; (c) give you a feel for typical content that might be explored in an interview. {{< br >}}{{< br >}} The class will be devoted entirely to the discussion of what you have learned in the interviews. {{< br >}}{{< br >}} **Project Group Assignment:** Interview guide due. {{< br >}}{{< br >}}  |
| 5 |  {{< br >}}{{< br >}} Guest Lecture: Jim Ferry, President, Boston Innovation Group (or BIG). {{< br >}}{{< br >}} Mr. Ferry is one of the leading practitioners of exploratory market research in the Boston area, and is also a professional focus group moderator.

| 6 |  {{< br >}}{{< br >}} Focus groups are the most widely used (and abused) qualitative market research method. We will spend the hour discussing the pro-s and con-s of focus groups. {{< br >}}{{< br >}} Read the case Boston Fights Drugs (A). Think about the following questions for class discussion:  {{< br >}}What did you think of the team's "model" for drug abuse?  {{< br >}}What do you make of the design of the pre-screening questionnaire and the focus group interview protocols?  {{< br >}}Are there data in the exhibits to support the team's conclusions on p. 10 of the case?  {{< br >}}Should they have used one-on-one interviews instead of focus groups? {{< br >}}{{< br >}} For a neat extension of focus group methodology, read "Focus Troops." {{< br >}}{{< br >}}  |
| 7 |  {{< br >}}{{< br >}} Observational methods.

| 9 |  {{< br >}}{{< br >}} We will look at how the customer's voices can be used to generate ideas and concepts for new products, and view a short video on the IDEO design company. {{< br >}}{{< br >}} Read "Spark innovation through empathic design," and skim Voices into Choices Steps 18 and 19. You might also look at articles on IDEO from their website, [http://www.ideo.com/](http://www.ideo.com/). {{< br >}}{{< br >}} "For a Seller of Innovation, a Bag of Technotricks" _NYTimes_, 2/1/99 (bottom of page).  {{< br >}}"A success in design minus the capital D " From the _London Times_  {{< br >}}[http://www.ideo.com/](http://www.ideo.com/). {{< br >}}{{< br >}} "Innovation for Fun and Profit." _Upside Magazine_, March 10, 2000. {{< br >}}{{< br >}}  |
